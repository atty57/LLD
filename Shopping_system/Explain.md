# Amazon Shopping System – Low-Level Design

## Overview

This document details the low-level design of an Amazon-like shopping system, built using robust object-oriented principles and a layered architecture. The system separates concerns across account management, product catalog, shopping flow, and order fulfillment, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

---

## Architecture & Layered Design

- **Account Management:** Handles user and admin accounts, including addresses and payment methods.
- **Product Management:** Manages the product catalog, product categories, and individual products.
- **Shopping Flow:** Manages shopping carts, orders, payments, invoices, and delivery tracking.

---

## Key Design Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern:**  
  `ProductCatalog` is a singleton, ensuring a single, consistent source of product data.

- **Template Method Pattern:**  
  Used in `Payment` and `Notification` classes, allowing subclasses to define specific steps while sharing a common workflow.

- **Composition Over Inheritance:**  
  Entities like `Address` and `Card` are composed within `Account`, reflecting strong ownership.

- **Factory Pattern (Implied):**  
  Unique ID generators (e.g., `generateOrderId`) act as factory methods for creating unique identifiers.

---

## Class Relationships

### Inheritance

- `Account` (abstract)
  - `User` (can shop, place orders)
  - `Admin` (can manage catalog and users)

### Composition

- `Account` contains:
  - `Address[]`
  - `Card[]` (`DebitCard`, `CreditCard`)
  - `Banking[]`
- `User` contains:
  - `ShoppingCart`
  - `Order[]`
- `Order` contains:
  - `Invoice`
  - `Status`

### Association

- `ProductCatalog` aggregates `Product[]`
- `Product` associated with `ProductCategory`
- `ShoppingCart` contains `Item[]` (each referencing a `Product`)
- `Order` references `User`, `Item[]`, `Payment`, `Invoice`, and `Status`

---

## Core Workflows

1. **User Registration & Setup**
   - New users register, creating a `User` object.
   - Users add addresses and payment methods (composed within their account).

2. **Product Search & Browsing**
   - Users search via `ProductSearchService` (implements `SearchInterface`).
   - Service queries the singleton `ProductCatalog`.

3. **Shopping Cart Management**
   - Each user has a `ShoppingCart`.
   - Adding products creates `Item` objects (with size, color, quantity).
   - Cart recalculates totals on updates.

4. **Order Placement**
   - Placing an order creates an `Order` with copies of cart items (price locked at purchase time).

5. **Payment Processing**
   - Payment handled polymorphically (`CashPayment`, `DebitCardPayment`, `CreditCardPayment`).
   - The order process is agnostic to payment type.

6. **Order Fulfillment**
   - Successful payment generates an `Invoice` and a `Status` object for tracking.
   - `Status` maintains a history and triggers notifications.

## Key Design Decisions & Benefits

- **Separation of Product and Item:**  
  `Product` is a catalog entry; `Item` captures user-specific choices (size, color) in carts/orders.

- **Payment Abstraction:**  
  The abstract `Payment` class enables easy addition of new payment methods (Open-Closed Principle).

- **Status Tracking with History:**  
  `Status` maintains a full history of order states, supporting detailed tracking and transparency.

- **Notification System:**  
  Abstract `Notification` allows for multiple channels (Email, SMS), easily extendable to others.

---

## Scalability & Extensibility

- **Product Expansion:**  
  Add new product types by creating new `ProductCategory` instances.

- **Payment Methods:**  
  Extend the `Payment` class for new payment types without impacting existing code.

- **Notification Channels:**  
  Implement new subclasses of `Notification` for additional communication methods.

- **Search Flexibility:**  
  `SearchInterface` allows for plug-and-play search implementations, including integration with external services.

- **Performance:**  
  The singleton `ProductCatalog` can be enhanced with caching for scalability.

## Conclusion

This low-level design provides a solid, extensible foundation for a scalable e-commerce system. It leverages proven design patterns, clear class relationships, and modular workflows to support both current functionality and future growth.
